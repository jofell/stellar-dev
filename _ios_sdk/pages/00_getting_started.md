The Stellar iOS SDK is built with dependency management in mind. [Cocoapods](http://www.cocoapods.org) is therefor a requirement for developers to be able to incorporate the full-featured Stellar iOS SDK into their projects and build loyalty applications in no time.

## Setting up Cocoapods

To set up cocoapods, open the Terminal app and invoke the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install cocoapods
{% endhighlight %}

If this doesn't work and requires you to have root access, invoke the following instead:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
{% endhighlight %}
